# Vitalsource PDF Converter

### Introduction
This python script converts Online Vitalsource Ebooks into PDF format. This is achieved by scraping the desired webpage for the content HTML and creating an offline replica while removing the specific tags that prevent the user from normally printing the page. With these tags removed the page is printed to a PDF format for universal use. Due to the fact that only one chapter is displayed per webpage this proccess will need to be repeated for each chapter you wish to download.

### Prerequisites 
This project relies on python3, Chrome version 81, and a few selective python packages. This script utilizes selenium with chromedriver. The current tested chromedriver is for Chrome version 81. If you are using an older version you can download and attempt to replace chromedriver.exe with the older chromedriver. NOTE: This has not been tested. This tool was specifically designed for a Windows environment so some changes will need to be made if you are using an alternative environment. Python dependencies can be installed  via:
```
pip install json
pip install selenium
```
